# C-language
# This is a compilation of small projects written in C, that I've worked on to learn programming. 
# Although these are some of my first projects, meant for learning new concepts, I assure you they are all fun and very interesting challenges.
# Some are or involve real-world cases of cleverly solving a problem mathematically or algorithmically.
